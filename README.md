# Analyzing Demographic-and-Regional-Disparities-in-Tele-Law-Case-Registrations-for-Inclusive-Legal-Access-

## üìñ Project Overview

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the **Tele-Law Case Registrations** dataset to uncover and examine demographic and regional disparities in access to legal services across India. The primary objective is to identify patterns of underrepresentation among different gender, caste, and regional groups. By providing a data-driven perspective on the service's equity, the study aims to offer insights that can help improve inclusive legal access for all citizens.

This repository is a submission for the IBM AICTE initiative.

## ‚ú® Key Findings & Results

The analysis revealed several key disparities in the usage of the Tele-Law service:

* **Gender Disparity**: There is a significant imbalance, with **males (24.8M)** utilizing the service far more than **females (15.9M)**.
* **Caste-based Disparity**: The **OBC and General** categories show the highest usage, suggesting a potential awareness or access gap for SC/ST communities.
* **Geographic Disparity**: Service adoption is highly concentrated in specific states, with **Uttar Pradesh and Bihar** accounting for the majority of case registrations.

**Note:** All visualizations and detailed statistical outputs are rendered directly within the `Tele-Law Analysis Notebook.ipynb` file.
